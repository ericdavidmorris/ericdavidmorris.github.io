#### About

I am currently a second-year MPH student in the [Department of Epidemiology](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/epidemiology), with a certificate in Advanced Epidemiology. I graduated from the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) in 2013 with a BA in the interdisciplinary [Distinguished Majors Program in Human Biology](http://www.virginia.edu/humanbiology/Home_page/home_page.htm). After graduating from UVA, I spent four years at the [Judith Jaffe Multiple Sclerosis Center at Weill Cornell](http://mscenter.weillcornell.org/) as a Senior Research Aide, performing clinical and imaging data analysis across a multitude of projects. 

For a full breakdown of my work and research experience, please find my *Curriculum Vitae* at the top right of this webpage.
