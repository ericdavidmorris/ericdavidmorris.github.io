This is a personal website built in October 2018 as part of the [Data Science course](http://p8105.com/index.html) in the Biostatistics Department of the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 

Included in this website are detailed summaries of my work and research experience, an example of a Plotly Flex Dashboard completed for the Data Science course, and links to my personal Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
