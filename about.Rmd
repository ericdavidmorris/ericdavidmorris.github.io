This is a personal website that was first built in October 2018 as part of the [Data Science course](http://p8105.com/index.html) in the Biostatistics Department of the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. 

Included in this website are detailed summaries of my work and research experience and links to my personal Twitter, LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.
